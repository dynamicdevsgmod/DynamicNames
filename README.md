# DynamicNames

Dynamic Names!

# GMS Info

Dynamic Names allows you to gracefully integrate a fun and serious roleplay experience into your DarkRP/StarWarsRP/SCP-RP/etc by prompting a menu whenever a player joins the server for the very first time. The menu allows them to set their first name, last name, and (if enabled) an ID number for things like a D-Class job. Not only this, but our prized feature is a robust prefix system that allows you to determine what you want your players to be named whenever they switch to another job! It works like this:

You set the job "Security Officer" to have the naming prefix "Officer #lastName". This means that if I were to join your server and play that security officer job, my name would be "Officer Okayguy"! You can have it in any combination, so be creative.

If you choose, admins may spawn an NPC that allows players to change their names for a price (it can also be free).
